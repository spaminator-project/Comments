The #introduceyourself tag is for creating one introductory post that tells us about you. Users are encouraged to use this tag exclusively for that and not to reuse it. 

Reusing the tag to trigger the welcoming bots and farm upvotes is considered both spam and exploitation. Repeated attempts to exploit and spam this tag will result in your account being Blacklisted.
